# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Summary
In this project, exploratory data analysis techniques were used to explore relationships between variables through R programming Language. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis was carried out. Various plots were used to understand the distribution and ranges of data. Finally a good understanding of data was acquired before any rigorous analysis could be carried out.

## Objectives
* Understanding the distribution of variables and to check for anomalies and outliers.
* Creating various plots like histogram, scatter plot etc. using ggplot package in R.
* Analyze the relationship among variables.

## Project Details
EDA techniques were used to analyze the features in the "wineQualityReds" dataset using R and RStudio IDE. The dataset contains information about red wines of various quality. A linear model was created to understand the relationship between wine quality and other features.

## Tools Used
* R Studio
* R Language
